1- Changing the Console Based Menu to a more usual tool behaviour which will work with single line commands such as:
--TEAnalyzer --genes.bed --te.bed --o /home/user/Desktop
2- Finding examples to test my program's counting function from Ensembl Database. Opened three mysql databases for human, mouse, and rat. Using -84 format rather than -89 format which is the most recent information because I have BAM files which are designed for -84 format.
